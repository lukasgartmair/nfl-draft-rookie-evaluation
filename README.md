# nfl_draft_rookie_evaluation
Python script to evaluate the nfl draft propescts based on their combines and the scout opinions

I use this script for the General Manager simulation 'Front Office Football Seven' in order to evaluate 
the prospects for every position. 

The most important rule from Pat Kirwan is 'Draft value before need'!

A metric for every position is calculated (based on individual preferences,
respectively with regard of the played system).

Finally a table is created that lists all the prospects whose metrics 
lie high above the average.
